Having created a decorated abstract syntax tree (AST) for your programming language, the next
task is to generate the LLVM IR code from it. LLVM IR code resembles a three-address code with
a human-readable representation. Therefore, we need a systematic approach to translate language
concepts such as control structures into the lower level of LLVM IR.

In this chapter, you will learn about the basics of LLVM IR and how to generate IR for control flow
structures from the AST. You will also learn how to generate LLVM IR for expressions in static single assignment (SSA) form using a modern algorithm. Finally, you will learn how to emit assembler text and object code.

在本章中，将了解以下内容:

\begin{itemize}
\item
使用AST生成IR

\item
使用AST编号生成SSA格式的IR代码

\item
设置模块和驱动程序
\end{itemize}

By the end of this chapter, you will know how to create a code generator for your programming
language and how to integrate it into your compiler.
