In this chapter, you learned how to implement a code generator for LLVM IR code. Basic blocks are important data structures that hold all the instructions and express branches. You learned how to create basic blocks for the control statements of the source language and how to add instructions to a basic block. You applied a modern algorithm to handle local variables in functions, leading to less IR code. The goal of a compiler is to generate assembler text or an object file for the input, so you also added a simple compilation pipeline. With this knowledge, you will be able to generate LLVM IR code and assembler text or object code for your language compiler.

In the next chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to deal with aggregate data structures and how to ensure that function calls comply with the rules of your platform.
