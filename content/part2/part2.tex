In this section, you will continue to learn how to develop your own compiler. You will begin by constructing the frontend, which reads the source file and creates an abstract syntax tree of it. Then, you will learn how to generate LLVM IR from the source file. Using the optimization capabilities of LLVM, you will then create optimized machine code. Additionally, you will explore several advanced topics, including generating LLVM IR for object-oriented language constructs and adding debug metadata.

This section comprises the following chapters:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Chapter 3, Turning the Source File into an Abstract Syntax Tree

\item
Chapter 4, Basics of IR Generation

\item
Chapter 5, IR Generation for High-Level Language Constructs

\item
Chapter 6, Advanced IR Generation

\item
Chapter 7, Optimizing IR
\end{itemize}
