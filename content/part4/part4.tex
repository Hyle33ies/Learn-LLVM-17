In this section, you will learn about adding a new backend target for a CPU architecture not supported by LLVM, utilizing the TableGen language. Additionally, you will explore the various instruction selection frameworks within LLVM and understand how to implement them. Finally, you will also delve into concepts beyond the instruction selection frameworks within LLVM, which are valuable for highly optimizing backends.

This section comprises the following chapters:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Chapter 11, The Target Description

\item
Chapter 12, Instruction Selection

\item
Chapter 13, Beyond Instruction Selection
\end{itemize}
