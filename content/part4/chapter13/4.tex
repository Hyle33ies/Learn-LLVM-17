In this chapter, you learned about creating passes that run beyond instruction selection, specifically exploring the creation behind machine function passes in the backend! You also discovered how to add a new experimental target into clang, and some of the driver, ABI, and toolchain changes that are required. Finally, while considering the supreme discipline of compiler construction, you learned how to cross-compile your application for another target architecture.

Now that weâ€™re at the end of Learn LLVM 17, you are equipped with the knowledge to use LLVM in creative ways in your projects and have explored many interesting topics. The LLVM ecosystem is very active, and new features are added all the time, so be sure to follow its development!

As compiler developers ourselves, it was a pleasure for us to write about LLVM and discover some new features along the way. Have fun with LLVM!
