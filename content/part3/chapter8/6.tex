In this chapter, you first learned the main idea behind TableGen. Then, you defined your first classes and records in the TableGen language, and you acquired knowledge of the syntax of TableGen. Finally, you developed a TableGen backend emitting fragments of C++ source code, based on the TableGen classes you defined.

In the next chapter, we examine another unique feature of LLVM: generating and executing code in one step, also known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
