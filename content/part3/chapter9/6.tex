In this chapter, you learned how to develop a JIT compiler. You began with learning about the possible applications of JIT compilers, and you explored lli, the LLVM dynamic compiler and interpreter. Using the predefined LLJIT class, you built an interactive JIT-based calculator tool and learned about looking up symbols and adding IR modules to LLJIT. To be able to take advantage of the layered structure of the ORC API, you also implemented an optimizing JIT class.

In the next chapter, you will learn how to utilize LLVM tools for debugging purposes.
