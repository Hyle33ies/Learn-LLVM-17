In order to learn how to work with LLVM, it is best to begin by compiling LLVM from source. LLVM is an umbrella project and the GitHub repository contains the source of all projects belonging to LLVM. Each LLVM project is in a top-level directory of the repository. Besides cloning the repository, your system must also have all tools installed that are required by the build system. In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Getting the prerequisites ready, which will show you how to set up your build system

\item 
Cloning the repository and building from source, which will cover how to get the LLVM source code, and how to compile and install the LLVM core libraries and clang with CMake and Ninja

\item 
Customizing the build process, which will talk about the various possibilities for influencing the build process
\end{itemize}
