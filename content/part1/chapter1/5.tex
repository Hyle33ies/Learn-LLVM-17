In this chapter, you prepared your development machine to compile LLVM. You cloned the GitHub repository and compiled your own version of LLVM and clang. The build process can be customized with CMake variables. You learned about useful variables and how to change them. Equipped with this knowledge, you can tweak LLVM to your needs.

In the next section, we will be taking a closer look at the structure of a compiler. We will be exploring the different components found inside the compiler, as well as different types of analyses that occur in it â€“ specifically, the lexical, syntactical, and semantic analyses. Finally, we will also briefly touch on interfacing with an LLVM backend for code generation.
