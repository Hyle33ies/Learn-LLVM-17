Writing a book takes time and energy. Without the support and understanding of my wife, Tanya, and my daughter Polina, this book would not have been possible. Thank you both for always encouraging me! 

Because of some personal challenges, this project was at risk, and I am grateful to Amy for joining me as an author. Without her, the book would not be as good as it is now.

Once again, the team at Packt not only provided guidance on my writing but also showed an understanding of my slow writing, and always motivated me to carry on. I owe them a great thank you.

2023 has been a very transformative year for me, and contributing my knowledge of LLVM to this book has been one of the reasons why this year has been so significant. I never would have thought that I would be approached by Kai to embark on this exciting journey to share LLVM 17 with you all! Thank you to Kai, for his technical mentorship and guidance, the team at Packt, and, of course, to my family and close loved ones for providing me with the support and motivation in writing this book.
